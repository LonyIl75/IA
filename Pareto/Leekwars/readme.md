## Leekwars 
Genetic extension developed for the Leekwars video game :
-   extraction of Leekwars features during gameplay, such as statistics, damage area, movement, and more.
-   parallelization of Leekwars games (in JAVA and Leek) + background script that collects and processes the results of these games (using Python).
-   genetic training using  a PHP server and python scripts (please note that these are not part of my work and are lorem ipsumized).
-   analysis of the massive data collected during all training sessions (certain parts of these analyses are also lorem ipsumized)
